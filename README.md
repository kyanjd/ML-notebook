# ML-studies

### Uni:
Contains my solutions to all available past papers, along with a fully commented cheat sheet that goes through example usages of different models with working attached when needed. Written tutorials that can be implemented in code are also covered. Note that all models are implemented at the NumPy level with no higher level libraries.

### Other:
(WIP) Implementations of models from papers for learning/practice
